# GSEM

The project will consist of a few parts. The event management system, the registration management system, and the website to facilitate recruitment. The website will be the main hub for running the software and filtrating users into the correct places. It will contain a way for users to subscribe to events, RSVP to specific events, Register for events, and comment on posts in the website. The event management system is what will publish events - which includes making the event live on the web page, sharing information with the user after registering (email services), and posting things to the calendar for event dates. The registration system will be a way for users to register for these said events. The webpage will provide functionality for us to get information from high school students, college students and the general public and convince them to come to school at Georgia Southern University. The system will also have the functionality to add applications to the website for other events.
